    <h2>Marco Parra</h2>
    <p>I'm mexican, i grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and i have been member since eight years old when i was baptized by my dad. I served a mission that started
        in Argentina in 2019 and continued and finished in Mexico by COVID-19 in 2021. I got married five months ago in the temple and i'm completely happy with my wife.  </p>
    <p>I love dogs, videogames and i try to spend my time learning, specially about technology. I'm currently working as technical support in a real estate agency, and that's why my wife call me "nerd", because
        i spend almost all my time with computers and smartphones, checking or reparing them. </p>
    <p>I chose "Web Design and Programming" because i have been working with computers since that i was ten years old, but i never was interested in programming until a few months ago, when i knew Pathway and i received holy guidance to study this.  </p>
